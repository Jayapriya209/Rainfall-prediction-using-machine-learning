# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

Predicting rainfall accurately is essential for agriculture planning, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.  
This project uses **machine learning techniques** to analyze historical weather data and predict rainfall based on key meteorological parameters.

---

## 🔎 Overview
Weather patterns are complex and often non-linear, making traditional prediction methods less effective.  
This project applies machine learning models to learn patterns from historical weather data and provide more reliable rainfall predictions using robust evaluation metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical weather data
- Preprocess and clean raw data
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics
- Identify the most effective model for rainfall prediction

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of historical weather parameters such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Rainfall

Publicly available weather datasets are used for training and testing the models.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Result Visualization

## 📈 Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented and compared:
- Naive bayes
- Random Forest

### 📏 Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score  

These metrics help avoid biased predictions and provide balanced performance evaluation.
