# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Rainfall prediction is an important task in meteorology as it helps in agriculture planning, water resource management, and disaster prevention.  
This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to predict rainfall based on historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

The goal is to analyze weather patterns and build an accurate model that can predict rainfall effectively.

📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of historical weather parameters such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind Speed

Rainfall

Publicly available weather datasets are used for training and testing.

📈 Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Each model is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

✅ Results

The models successfully learned weather patterns from historical data.

Random Forest achieved better performance compared to other models.

Evaluation metrics are used instead of accuracy alone to avoid biased results.

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world weather forecasting problems.
The results show that ML models can effectively predict rainfall when trained with quality data and proper preprocessing.

🔮 Future Enhancements
