# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Rainfall prediction is an important task in meteorology as it helps in agriculture planning, water resource management, and disaster prevention.  
This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to predict rainfall based on historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

The goal is to analyze weather patterns and build an accurate model that can predict rainfall effectively.
